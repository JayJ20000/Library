How to compile and run
    Run "make"
    Then run the executable with "./library"

Challenges
    The main problem was getting it to run. The makefile was not making an executable so the program can be ran.
    Dealing with the attributes of the books when adding or deleting a book from a file
    Designing the main menu in the main file to be readable and working. Ran into many problems with getting the files to be read and printed out correctly
    Making sure the program can accept and ouptut error messages when the wrong file or data being read
    Handling memory! Allocating and deallocating pointers were a hassle to handle
